The Scaffold-DbContext command is used in Entity Framework Core to reverse engineer an existing database 
    and create the corresponding entity models and a DbContext class in your project. 
    This command generates code based on the schema of the specified database. Here's a detailed breakdown of the provided command:


Scaffold-DbContext "Server=STOYAN;Database=SoftUni;User Id=sa;Password=558955;Trusted_Connection=True;" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -DataAnnotations -Context SoftUniDbContext -ContextDir Data -OutputDir Data/Models

Breakdown of the Command
Scaffold-DbContext:

This is the command to scaffold(generate) a DbContext and entity classes for a specified database.

Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer:

This specifies the provider to be used for the SQL Server database. Entity Framework Core supports multiple database providers, and this one is for SQL Server.

-DataAnnotations:

This option specifies that the generated classes should use data annotations to configure the model. 
    Data annotations are attributes you can apply directly to your classes and properties to configure how they map to the database.

-Context SoftUniDbContext:
This specifies the name of the DbContext class to be generated. In this case, the class will be named SoftUniDbContext.

-ContextDir Data:
This specifies the directory where the DbContext class should be placed. The SoftUniDbContext class will be generated in the Data directory.

-OutputDir Data/Models:
This specifies the directory where the entity classes should be placed. The entity classes representing the database tables will be generated in the Data/Models directory.

Example of the Resulting Files
After running this command, you can expect to have the following structure in your project:


YourProject:

folder \Data
file in folder Data => SoftUniDbContext.cs        // The DbContext class
folder /Models
files in folder Models => Department.cs           // Entity class for a table in the database
                          Employee.cs            // Another entity class


Summary
The Scaffold-DbContext command is a powerful tool in Entity Framework Core that allows you to generate C# classes from an existing database schema. 
This command leverages the connection string to connect to the database, 
    specifies the SQL Server provider, and uses options like -DataAnnotations, -Context, -ContextDir, and -OutputDir to configure how the generated classes should be organized and annotated. 
    This greatly simplifies the process of setting up a new EF Core data model based on an existing database.
