Explicit loading is useful when you need to load related data on-demand, providing you with more control over the data retrieval process and potentially improving performance by reducing unnecessary data loading.

Types of Data You Can Load Explicitly
Collection Navigation Properties: These are properties that represent a collection of related entities (e.g., a Blog entity that has many Post entities).
Reference Navigation Properties: These are properties that represent a single related entity (e.g., a Post entity that has a single Blog entity).

Explicit loading in Entity Framework Core allows you to load related data that is connected through foreign keys in your entities.
Loads data immediately at the moment we wanted.
