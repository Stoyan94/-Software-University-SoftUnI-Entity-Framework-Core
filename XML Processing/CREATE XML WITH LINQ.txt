Create a new XDocument:


XDocument doc3 = new XDocument();
This line initializes a new XDocument object named doc3. An XDocument represents an XML document in memory.


Add a root element to the document:

doc3.Add(new XElement("cars"));
This line adds a new root element <cars> to the doc3 document. The XElement represents an XML element.


Add a child element to the root element:

doc3.Root.Add(new XElement("car"));
This line adds a child element <car> to the root <cars> element. The Root property gets the root element of the document.

Get the first (and only) <car> element:

XElement car = doc3.Root.Elements().First();
This line retrieves the first <car> element from the root element <cars>. The Elements() method returns a collection of child elements, and First() gets the first element in that collection.


Add child elements to the <car> element:

car.Add(new XElement("maker", "Renault"));
car.Add(new XElement("model", "Megan"));

These lines add two child elements to the <car> element:
<maker> with the value "Renault".
<model> with the value "Megan".

Save the document to a file:

doc3.Save("cars.xml");
This line saves the XML document to a file named "cars.xml".
Final XML Structure
After running this code, the "cars.xml" file will have the following structure:

xml
Copy code
<cars>
  <car>
    <maker>Renault</maker>
    <model>Megan</model>
  </car>
</cars>

Summary
A new XML document is created.
A root element <cars> is added.
A child element <car> is added to the root.
The <car> element is populated with <maker> and <model> elements.
The XML document is saved to "cars.xml".
