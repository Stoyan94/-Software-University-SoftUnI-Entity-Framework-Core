Why i need to make this 

List<Customer> customerList = customersImportDtos.
    Select(dto => new Customer()
    {
        Name = dto.Name,
        BirthDate = dto.BirthDate,
        IsYoungDriver = dto.IsYoungDriver
    })
    .ToList();
	
and not just add this collection directly List<CustomersImportDto> customersImportDtos;



The reason you need to convert the list of CustomersImportDto into a list of Customer entities is that CustomersImportDto is typically a Data Transfer Object (DTO), 
which serves a different purpose than an Entity class like Customer. Here's why you can't directly add the DTO collection to the database context:

1. DTO vs. Entity Purpose
DTO (Data Transfer Object):

Designed to represent and transfer data, often in a simpler or flattened structure.
Used for communication between different layers (e.g., controller and service) or systems (e.g., an API and your application).
Does not map directly to database tables.
Entity:

Represents the data as it is modeled in the database.
Contains relationships, constraints, and logic specific to database operations.
Directly tied to the Entity Framework and the database context.
If you try to add a DTO (like CustomersImportDto) directly to the database context, Entity Framework will not know how to map it to the database schema, because CustomersImportDto is not an entity.

2. Lack of Relationship Mapping
In most cases, entities have additional relationships or properties that are not part of the DTO. For example:

The Customer entity might have navigation properties or foreign keys (Orders, Addresses, etc.).
These are necessary for database integrity and operation but are not present in the DTO.
By converting CustomersImportDto into Customer, you can ensure all necessary mappings and relationships are respected.

3. Separation of Concerns
The DTO layer is responsible for external communication (e.g., receiving data from XML or an API).
The entity layer is responsible for internal data representation and persistence in the database.
Mixing these layers (e.g., directly adding a DTO to the database context) violates the principle of separation of concerns, making your code harder to maintain and extend.

4. Validation and Transformation
When mapping a DTO to an entity, you can:

Validate the data before creating entities (e.g., ensuring required fields are not null).
Transform or enrich the data as needed (e.g., converting formats or adding calculated properties).
If you add the DTO directly to the database, you lose the opportunity for such intermediate processing.

5. ToList() for Materialization
The call to .ToList() is necessary because:

LINQ queries are deferred until enumeration. Calling .ToList() ensures the mapping process is executed immediately and results in a concrete List<Customer>.
This prepares the list for operations like adding it to the database context with AddRange.
Example
Consider this DTO and entity:


DTO:

public class CustomersImportDto
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public DateTime BirthDate { get; set; }
    public bool IsYoungDriver { get; set; }
}


Entity:

public class Customer
{
    public int Id { get; set; } // Auto-incremented database primary key
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public DateTime BirthDate { get; set; }
    public bool IsYoungDriver { get; set; }
    public ICollection<Order> Orders { get; set; } = new List<Order>(); // Navigation property
}
The entity has an Id (for the primary key) and a relationship (Orders), which are not part of the DTO. You need to map the DTO into the corresponding entity to work correctly with the database.

Why Mapping Ensures Success
The following process ensures smooth interaction with the database:

The XML or API delivers data in the form of a DTO (CustomersImportDto).
You map the DTO to the Customer entity, aligning with the database schema.
Add the entities to the database context, ensuring Entity Framework knows how to handle them.
Attempting to Skip the Mapping
If you try to directly add List<CustomersImportDto> to the database:

Entity Framework will throw an exception because it doesn’t recognize CustomersImportDto as a valid database entity.
Relationships and additional fields required by the database schema won’t be handled correctly.
In Summary
Mapping from CustomersImportDto to Customer ensures:

Compatibility with the database schema.
Proper handling of relationships and navigation properties.
Clear separation of concerns between DTOs (data transfer) and entities (data persistence).
This approach is essential for robust, maintainable, and scalable code.
