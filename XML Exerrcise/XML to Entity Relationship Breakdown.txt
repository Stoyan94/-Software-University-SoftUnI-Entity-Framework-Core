XmlSerializer xmlSerializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(List<CarsImportDto>),
    new XmlRootAttribute("Cars"));
	
Purpose: Creates an XmlSerializer instance to handle XML serialization and deserialization for a collection of CarsImportDto objects.
Custom Root Attribute: The XML's root element is expected to be <Cars>, matching the specified XmlRootAttribute.

Code:

List<CarsImportDto> carsImportDto;

using (var reader = new StringReader(inputXml))
{
    carsImportDto = (List<CarsImportDto>)xmlSerializer.Deserialize(reader);
}
Input: A string inputXml containing the XML data to process.
StringReader: Converts the string into a readable stream for the serializer.
Deserialization: Converts the XML structure into a strongly typed List<CarsImportDto>.
Result: carsImportDto is populated with data from the XML.



2. Preparing the List of Cars
Code:
List<Car> cars = new List<Car>();
Purpose: Initializes an empty list to store fully constructed Car entities after processing.



3. Processing Each CarsImportDto
Code:

foreach (var dto in carsImportDto)
{
    Car car = new Car()
    {
        Make = dto.Make,
        Model = dto.Model,
        TraveledDistance = dto.TraveledDistance
    };
Looping: Iterates over each deserialized CarsImportDto object.
Mapping: Creates a new Car object for each DTO, transferring:
Make: The car's manufacturer (e.g., "Toyota").
Model: The car's specific model (e.g., "Corolla").
TraveledDistance: Total distance the car has traveled.


4. Extracting and Processing Part IDs
Code:
List<int> carPartsIds = dto.PartIds
    .Select(p => p.Id)
    .Distinct()
    .ToList();
dto.PartIds: Contains the list of part IDs associated with the car.
Extraction:

Uses LINQ to extract unique part IDs (Distinct).
Converts them into a List<int>.



5. Creating PartCar Relationships
Code:

List<PartCar> carParts = new List<PartCar>();

foreach (var id in carPartsIds)
{
    carParts.Add(new PartCar()
    {
        Car = car,
        PartId = id
    });
}
PartCar Creation: For each unique part ID:
A new PartCar is created to link the Car and Part entities.
Car is set to the current Car object.
PartId is set to the current part ID.
carParts List: Collects all PartCar objects for the current car.



6. Linking Parts to the Car
Code:

car.PartsCars = carParts;
cars.Add(car);

Updating the Car:
The PartsCars property of the Car object is populated with the constructed PartCar list.
Adding to List:
The fully populated Car is added to the cars list.

7. Final Output
Code:

return $"Successfully imported {cars.Count}";
Message: Returns a success message indicating the number of Car objects successfully processed.
