(1 - (dto.Discount / 100))
This calculates how much of the price is left after applying the discount.

dto.Discount: The discount percentage (e.g., 10 for 10%).
dto.Discount / 100: Converts the percentage to a decimal (e.g., 10 becomes 0.1).
1 - ...: Subtracts the discount to find the remaining percentage.

Example: If Discount is 10%, 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 (90% of the price is left).
Multiply These Together
The total price of the car parts is multiplied by the remaining percentage after the discount:
Total Price * (1 - Discount)

Example: If the total price is 600 and the discount is 10%, the result will be:
600 * 0.9 = 540.

(double)
This converts the result into a double type, which allows for decimal numbers (e.g., 540.0 instead of just 540).

Round(..., 4)
Finally, the result is rounded to 4 decimal places.

If the result is 540.12345, it becomes 540.1235.
Simplified Example

Letâ€™s say:

PartsCars contains parts priced at 100, 200, and 300.
Discount is 10%.
Sum of prices: 100 + 200 + 300 = 600.
Remaining after discount: 1 - (10 / 100) = 0.9.
Discounted total: 600 * 0.9 = 540.0.
Rounded to 4 decimal places: 540.0000.
