When you use Data Annotations (like [ForeignKey(nameof(Employee))]), you do not need to duplicate the foreign key configurations in the Fluent API unless you want to configure additional aspects of the relationships that cannot be done with data annotations alone.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

1. Data Annotations (Your Current Approach):
By using the [ForeignKey] attribute on properties (EmployeeId and ProjectId), you are already telling EF Core how to establish the foreign key relationships.
This is sufficient for simple foreign key relationships. EF Core will infer the relationships based on the annotations and will handle the foreign keys for you.

2. Fluent API (When to Use It):
You would use the Fluent API for more advanced configurations or when you need more control over:

Cascading behaviors (e.g., Cascade or Restrict on delete).
Many-to-many or one-to-one relationships (more complex scenarios).
Custom column names for foreign keys or navigation properties.
Configuring relationships where data annotations don't provide enough flexibility (e.g., composite keys, multiple foreign keys).

Fluent API and Data Annotations:
No Duplication Required: If you've already declared the relationships using [ForeignKey], EF Core automatically creates the foreign keys and relationships for you. Using Fluent API in addition to this would be redundant unless you're customizing the relationships further.

When to Use Fluent API Only:
If you prefer Fluent API over Data Annotations, you can remove the [ForeignKey] attributes and declare the relationships entirely in the Fluent API like so:


entity.HasOne(e => e.Employee)
      .WithMany(e => e.EmployeesProjects)
      .HasForeignKey(e => e.EmployeeId);

entity.HasOne(p => p.Project)
      .WithMany(p => p.EmployeesProjects)
      .HasForeignKey(p => p.ProjectId);

Conclusion:
Data Annotations: Sufficient for simple foreign key relationships.
Fluent API: Needed only for more complex configurations or advanced control.
If your foreign key relationships are straightforward and you don't need advanced configurations, you do not need to declare the relationships again in the Fluent API. You can safely rely on the [ForeignKey] attributes.
