What is ORM ?
Object - Relational Mapping(ORM) is a programming technique used to interact with a relational database using object-oriented programming(OOP) concepts.ORM allows developers to map database tables to classes in code and rows of those tables to objects of those classes.

This abstraction reduces the need for manual SQL queries by providing an interface for working with database data using the programming language's constructs.

Key Features of ORM
Object-Relational Mapping:

Database tables are represented as classes.
Table rows are represented as objects.
Columns map to object properties.
Database Abstraction:

You interact with the database using the language's OOP features instead of raw SQL.
CRUD Operations:

Simplifies Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
Query Generation:

ORMs generate SQL queries automatically based on object manipulation.
Benefits of Using ORM
Reduces Boilerplate Code:

Eliminates repetitive SQL statements by abstracting database interactions.
Improved Productivity:

Developers work with high-level constructs instead of writing SQL for every operation.
Ease of Maintenance:

Changes to database structure (e.g., adding columns) require fewer modifications in the codebase.
Portable Code:

Abstracts away database-specific details, allowing you to switch databases with minimal code changes.
Security:

Prevents common vulnerabilities like SQL injection by parameterizing queries automatically.
How ORM Works
Example Without ORM
Here’s how database interaction might look without an ORM:

using (var connection = new SqlConnection("connection-string"))
{
    connection.Open();
    var command = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Id = @Id", connection);
    command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Id", 1);

    using (var reader = command.ExecuteReader())
    {
        while (reader.Read())
        {
            var user = new User
            {
                Id = reader.GetInt32(0),
                Name = reader.GetString(1)
            };
        }
    }
}

Example With ORM (Entity Framework)
Using an ORM simplifies the above:

using (var context = new AppDbContext())
{
    var user = context.Users.FirstOrDefault(u => u.Id == 1);
}


Popular ORM Frameworks
C# / .NET:

Ruby:
Active Record(Ruby on Rails)
Common ORM Concepts

Entities:
Classes that represent database tables.

Relationships:
Map table relationships (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many) to object relationships.

Migrations:
Manage changes to the database schema programmatically.

Lazy Loading:
Load related data only when accessed.

Eager Loading:
Preload related data to reduce database queries.

When to Use ORM
Use ORM when:
You want to speed up development and reduce SQL boilerplate.
The application heavily uses object-oriented design patterns.
There’s a need for seamless database schema evolution.

Avoid ORM when:
Performance is critical, and raw SQL can be optimized better.
You have complex queries that don't map well to objects.

ORM is a powerful tool for abstracting database interactions, 
but understanding its limitations and overhead is key to using it effectively.
