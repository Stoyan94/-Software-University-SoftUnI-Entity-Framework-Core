The Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design package in Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is necessary for using certain design-time tools, 
especially when you are working with migrations and scaffolding. Here’s why you might need it:

Migrations: 
If you're using migrations to manage changes to your database schema, 
the Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design package provides the underlying support for creating, updating, and applying migrations.

For example, the commands like Add-Migration, Update-Database, and Remove-Migration rely on this package to generate the migration code and execute database updates.


Scaffolding:
When you're generating models from an existing database (reverse engineering), the package provides design-time services to facilitate this. 
For example, commands like Scaffold-DbContext use this package to generate your DbContext and model classes from an existing database schema.


Command-line tools: 
If you're using EF Core tools via the CLI (Command-Line Interface) or the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio, this package is a prerequisite for these tools to work properly during development.


In summary, you need Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design when you want to work with EF Core migrations or scaffolding, as it provides the necessary design-time services for these operations.

==================================================================================================

The Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools package is used to provide Entity Framework Core command-line tools that help you manage your database schema and perform other database-related tasks.
Here's why and when you need it:

Key Use Cases of Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools:
Migrations:

This package allows you to run migrations from the command line (CLI) or from the Package Manager Console (PMC) in Visual Studio.
Common migration-related commands:
Add-Migration <Name>: Creates a new migration with the specified name.
Update-Database: Applies pending migrations to the database.
Remove-Migration: Removes the last migration.

Database Scaffolding (Reverse Engineering):

You can generate your EF Core model (DbContext and entity classes) from an existing database.
Command: Scaffold-DbContext


Running Queries or Debugging:

Sometimes, you may want to generate the SQL queries that EF Core will execute. This package helps you to run and debug queries using EF Core at design-time.
Why Do You Need It?
While Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design provides the design-time services for migrations and scaffolding,
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools provides the actual commands you need to execute migrations, update databases, scaffold your models, 
and work with the database from the command line or PMC.

In short, if you're going to use the EF Core CLI or Visual Studio Package Manager Console for migration management, database updates, or scaffolding, you need to install this package.

==============================================================================================


Actually, both Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design and Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools are required for migrations, but they serve different purposes.
Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. Migrations:
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools: This package provides the actual commands (Add-Migration, Update-Database, etc.) for working with migrations from the command line or Package Manager Console.
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design: This package provides the design-time services needed for the migrations to work, such as code generation and the underlying mechanisms to create migration files and apply them to the database.
So, to use migrations, both packages are necessary:

Tools gives you the commands to work with migrations.
Design enables the design-time functionality to generate migration code, apply migrations, and scaffold entities.


2. Scaffolding (Reverse Engineering):
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools: Provides the scaffold command (Scaffold-DbContext) to generate the models and DbContext from an existing database.
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design: Required to provide the design-time services needed for scaffolding, including reverse engineering and code generation.

Summary:
For migrations: You need both Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools and Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design.
For scaffolding (reverse engineering): You also need both packages, as Design provides the underlying design-time functionality, while Tools gives you the command to scaffold the models.
Both packages work together for both migrations and scaffolding, but Tools provides the commands, and Design provides the design-time services.
