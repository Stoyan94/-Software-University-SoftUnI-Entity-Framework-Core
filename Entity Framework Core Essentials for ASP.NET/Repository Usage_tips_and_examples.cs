What is a Repository ?
A Repository is a design pattern used in software development to abstract and encapsulate data access logic. It acts as a mediator between the application’s business logic and the data access layer (e.g., a database or an ORM like Entity Framework).

The key idea is to provide a clean API for data operations (like retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting records) without exposing the underlying data storage implementation.

Why Use a Repository?
The Repository pattern offers several benefits:

1.Separation of Concerns
Keeps the business logic (services, controllers) separate from data access logic.
Improves code organization and readability.

2. Abstraction
Hides the complexity of database queries or ORM operations, allowing the business layer to interact with repositories without worrying about implementation details.

3. Testability
Repositories are easier to mock or stub for unit testing. This allows you to test your business logic independently of the database.

4. Consistency
Centralizes data access logic in one place, promoting reusable and maintainable code.

5. Flexibility
Makes it easier to switch to a different data source or ORM without changing the higher-level code (e.g., switching from Entity Framework to Dapper).

When to Use a Repository?
The Repository pattern is most useful in scenarios where:

Complex Applications

The application has complex business logic that requires interaction with multiple data sources or repositories.
The data access logic is not trivial, and reusability is needed.
Test-Driven Development

If your project emphasizes testability, repositories make it easier to isolate and mock the data access layer during unit testing.
Abstraction Needed

When you need a clean abstraction to hide database-specific code from the rest of your application.
Consistency Across Multiple Data Sources

If your application interacts with multiple databases or APIs, a repository can standardize how data is accessed.
When NOT to Use It:
Simple Applications: For small projects with straightforward CRUD operations, using a repository may add unnecessary complexity.
Overhead in Simple Scenarios: If the application only uses a single database with minimal business logic, Entity Framework's DbSet<T> already provides basic repository-like functionality.
How the Repository Pattern Works
Here's how the Repository pattern fits into a typical application structure:

Controller or Business Logic: Calls a service or directly interacts with a repository to perform data operations.
Repository: Encapsulates the data access logic (e.g., Entity Framework, SQL queries) and provides a clean API to the rest of the application.
Database or Data Source: The actual storage backend (SQL, NoSQL, in-memory collections, etc.).
Example Use Case
Scenario:
You are building an e-commerce application where you need to:

Retrieve products by category.
Add new orders.
Update user details.
Using a Repository Pattern:

You create a ProductRepository to encapsulate all product-related data access logic.
You create an OrderRepository to handle order-related operations.
The business layer interacts only with these repositories, unaware of whether the data comes from a database or an external API.
Code Example
Without Repository (Tightly Coupled Code):

public class ProductService
{
    private readonly AppDbContext _context;

    public ProductService(AppDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public IEnumerable<Product> GetAllProducts()
    {
        return _context.Products.ToList();
    }

    public Product GetProductById(int id)
    {
        return _context.Products.Find(id);
    }
}

With Repository(Loosely Coupled Code):

public interface IProductRepository
{
    IEnumerable<Product> GetAll();
    Product GetById(int id);
}

public class ProductRepository : IProductRepository
{
    private readonly AppDbContext _context;

    public ProductRepository(AppDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public IEnumerable<Product> GetAll()
    {
        return _context.Products.ToList();
    }

    public Product GetById(int id)
    {
        return _context.Products.Find(id);
    }
}
The ProductService now depends on IProductRepository, making it easier to test and swap implementations.

Advantages of Using a Repository
Decoupling: Business logic doesn't need to worry about how data is stored or retrieved.
Centralized Logic: Changes in data access logic are centralized, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.
Mocking and Testing: Business logic can be tested without requiring a live database.
