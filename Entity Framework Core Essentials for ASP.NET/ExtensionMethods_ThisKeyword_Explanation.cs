Role of this Keyword

In the method declaration:

public static void Seed(this ModelBuilder modelBuilder)

The this keyword before the first parameter (ModelBuilder modelBuilder) indicates that Seed is an extension method for the ModelBuilder class.
This allows you to call the method as if it were a regular method of the ModelBuilder class, like this:

modelBuilder.Seed();
Without the this keyword, the method would be a regular static method, and you would have to call it like this:

ModulBuilderExtension.Seed(modelBuilder);


Advantages of Using this in Extension Methods

Improved Readability:
Using modelBuilder.Seed() is more natural and intuitive than ModulBuilderExtension.Seed(modelBuilder).

Fluent API Style:
It integrates seamlessly with the existing methods of ModelBuilder, allowing you to write cleaner and more fluent code.

Non-Intrusive:
You don’t have to modify the ModelBuilder class to add the Seed method. 
    This is especially useful when working with external or framework-provided classes.

When to Use this in Extension Methods?
Use this when you want to add new methods to an existing class in a non-invasive way, and you want those methods to behave like built-in methods of that class.

Example Without this
If you remove this from the parameter, you must call the method like this:

ModulBuilderExtension.Seed(modelBuilder);
This defeats the purpose of making it an extension method, as it looks like a regular static method.

By using this, you turn:

modelBuilder.Seed();
Into a seamless and intuitive extension of the ModelBuilder API.
