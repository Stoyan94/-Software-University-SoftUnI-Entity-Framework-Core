1.Cross - Platform Support
ASP.NET: Runs only on Windows, typically hosted on IIS (Internet Information Services).
ASP.NET Core: Cross - platform; it can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS. It can be hosted using Kestrel (the internal web server) or on IIS, Nginx, or Apache.

2. Performance
ASP.NET: While ASP.NET is relatively fast, it isn't as optimized for modern performance needs.
ASP.NET Core: Significantly faster and more efficient than ASP.NET due to its lightweight design and improvements in the underlying framework.

3. Modularity
ASP.NET: Monolithic in nature; it includes many components that may not be needed in every project, resulting in larger applications.
ASP.NET Core: Highly modular and lightweight. You can include only the necessary components for your application, which reduces overhead and allows for faster performance.

4. Dependency Injection
ASP.NET: Dependency Injection(DI) is not built -in and must be manually configured.
ASP.NET Core: DI is built -in and first-class, making it easier to manage dependencies and test the application.

5. Hosting
ASP.NET: Typically hosted in IIS, making it Windows-centric.
ASP.NET Core: Can be hosted in multiple environments, including IIS, Nginx, Apache, or in a self-hosted environment using Kestrel, making it more flexible.

6. Configuration
ASP.NET: Configuration management is less flexible, with settings often stored in Web.config files.
ASP.NET Core: Configuration is more flexible and can be stored in JSON files (appsettings.json), environment variables, or a variety of other sources, making it easier to manage across different environments.

7. Routing
ASP.NET: Uses traditional routing systems that are more rigid.
ASP.NET Core: Has a more modern and flexible routing system. It also supports attribute routing and more sophisticated route matching.

8. Startup and Middleware
ASP.NET: It doesn't have a direct concept of middleware but instead uses HTTP Handlers and Modules.
ASP.NET Core: Introduces a middleware pipeline, allowing you to build flexible and modular application logic where each middleware component can handle requests and responses.

9. Web Forms Support
ASP.NET: Includes Web Forms, which is a framework for building user interfaces based on server-side controls.
ASP.NET Core: Does not include Web Forms. It focuses more on modern web development practices like MVC and Razor Pages.

10. Entity Framework (EF)
ASP.NET: Uses Entity Framework for data access, but there are some limitations in terms of modern features and performance.
ASP.NET Core: Uses Entity Framework Core (EF Core), which is a lightweight, cross-platform version of EF with significant improvements, such as better performance, support for NoSQL databases, and more.

11. Deployment
ASP.NET: Typically deployed via IIS on Windows servers.
ASP.NET Core: Supports deployment to a variety of environments, including cloud, on-premises servers, or containers (e.g., Docker), giving developers more flexibility.

12. Versioning and Updates
ASP.NET: Updates are tied to the .NET Framework, which can be slower and requires more maintenance for backward compatibility.
ASP.NET Core: Uses.NET Core, which is designed to be modular and lightweight. Updates are more frequent, and applications are easier to upgrade to newer versions.

13. Legacy Support
ASP.NET: Supports legacy web forms, Web API, and MVC applications.
ASP.NET Core: Focuses on modern development practices and does not support Web Forms or some of the older ASP.NET paradigms.

14. Security
ASP.NET: While secure, some of the security features are tied to Windows-based environments (e.g., Windows Authentication).
ASP.NET Core: Includes enhanced security features and is more flexible when it comes to authentication, allowing you to implement more modern techniques like OAuth, JWT, etc.

Summary of Key Differences:
Platform Support: ASP.NET is Windows - only, while ASP.NET Core is cross - platform.
Performance: ASP.NET Core is faster and more efficient.
Architecture: ASP.NET Core is more modular, with built-in DI and flexible routing.
Hosting: ASP.NET Core offers more hosting options (e.g., Kestrel, Nginx, IIS).
Modern Practices: ASP.NET Core focuses on modern web development (e.g., no Web Forms, emphasis on REST APIs and MVC).
In conclusion, ASP.NET Core is the more modern, flexible, and high-performance option, and it is the recommended framework for new web application development.However, if you need to maintain legacy ASP.NET applications, you may still work with the older version.
