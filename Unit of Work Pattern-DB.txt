The Unit of Work pattern is a design pattern used to manage transactions in a database by treating a series of operations as a single unit. It ensures that either all operations succeed and are committed, or if any operation fails, all changes are rolled back, maintaining data consistency. The pattern tracks changes to entities, reduces repetitive transaction code, and improves efficiency by batching database operations. It's commonly used in scenarios where multiple related changes need to be made to a database in a coordinated manner.
