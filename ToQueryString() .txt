 The ToQueryString() method generates the actual SQL query as a string without executing it.

Example:
Assuming you have an Employees table with columns FirstName, LastName, and Salary, the ToQueryString() method will return a SQL query similar to this:

sql
code
SELECT [e].[FirstName], [e].[LastName], [e].[Salary]
FROM [Employees] AS [e]

Explanation:
The .Select(e => new { e.FirstName, e.LastName, e.Salary }) selects only the specified columns (FirstName, LastName, Salary) from the Employees table.
ToQueryString() translates the LINQ query into the corresponding SQL command.
This generated SQL is returned as a string and printed out with Console.WriteLine().

Key Points:
No data is actually fetched from the database when using ToQueryString(); it only outputs the SQL query string.
This can be useful for debugging or understanding what SQL is being generated by EF Core.
