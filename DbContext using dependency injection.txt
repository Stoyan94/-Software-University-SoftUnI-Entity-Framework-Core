Default Constructor

public StudentSystemDbContext()
{

}
This is a parameterless constructor. It doesn't do anything specific in this context but allows the creation of a StudentSystemDbContext instance without passing any arguments. It might be used by tools or frameworks that need to create an instance of your context class without knowing about any specific configurations.

Constructor with DbContextOptions

public StudentSystemDbContext(DbContextOptions options) 
    : base(options)
{
}
This constructor takes a DbContextOptions object as a parameter and passes it to the base class (DbContext) constructor. Here's what each part does:

DbContextOptions options: This parameter contains configuration information for the DbContext, such as the database provider (SQL Server, SQLite, etc.), connection string, and any other options required to configure the context.

: base(options): This part is known as a constructor initializer. It calls the constructor of the base class (DbContext) with the provided options. This ensures that the DbContext is configured according to the settings specified in the DbContextOptions.

Purpose and Usage
Dependency Injection: In modern applications, especially ASP.NET Core applications, the constructor with DbContextOptions is typically used to enable dependency injection. This allows the DbContext to be configured and managed by the dependency injection container.

Configuration: By passing DbContextOptions to the base constructor, you can configure your DbContext to use a specific database provider, connection string, and other options. This is a flexible way to configure your database context at runtime.

Example of Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core
Hereâ€™s an example of how you might configure and use this DbContext in an ASP.NET Core application:

Define the DbContext class:

public class StudentSystemDbContext : DbContext
{
    public StudentSystemDbContext(DbContextOptions<StudentSystemDbContext> options) 
        : base(options)
    {
    }

    public DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Course> Courses { get; set; }
}

Summary
Parameterless Constructor: Allows the creation of a StudentSystemDbContext instance without configuration.
Constructor with DbContextOptions: Enables the configuration of the DbContext using dependency injection, making it flexible and manageable within the application's service container.
